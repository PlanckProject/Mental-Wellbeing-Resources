# Mental-Wellbeing-Resources

This idea of cumulating mental wellbeing resources has been put forward by Trisanki Saikia. Ms. Saikia is a Research Assistant at Solidaridad Network and is working in Global Climate and Landscape Innovation Taskforce in the German office of the network.

She put forward this message to the audience:

> Dear all,
> 
> A couple of days ago I sought out help for a friend who was suffering from depression and anxiety for some time. The response I received was overwhelming - I got hundreds of suggestions. 
> 
> Something which struck me even more was that people wrote to me asking to share these resources since they did not want to come out publicly about what they were going through. I know its hard to find the right resources when you are seeking help and some do not want to seek help from close ones. So I thought to ask help from people once again. 
> 
> The response gives me immense hope. What more I learnt that there is more than just counselling for those seeking help - life coaching, spiritual help, support groups etc. So I have decided to collate the information and share it as a public resource for anyone who needs it.
